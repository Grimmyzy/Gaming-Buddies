  For Honor
</h2>
  
   
      <p class="glowText2" id="pmaintext">
    For Honor is a Ubisoft game which introduces high dynamic medival combat.
    There are 5 main fractions in the game. Each fraction has characters representing their relevant timeline for example in the fraction of Vikings you would find characters that would resemble different types of warriors from the Viking times. 
   You also have Samurai and Wu Lin which represent ancient Japanese and Chinese fighters. Each characters comes with a different weapon and playstyle. And requires you to learn the movement and attack combinations. 
 
    
    
      </p>
      <p class="glowText2" id="pmaintext">
    For Honor comes with a unique play style unline many other games of the similar genre. You are able to deflect, parry or couter your enemys attacks but only if you time and aim your attack the correct way. 
  
  
    Once you lock onto an enemy during combat on your screen you will see three curved lines. One on the right side, one on the left side and one on the top side. These represent the directions in which you may attack but also defend. 
    When an enemy that you are locked onto attacks you a red flashing line will appear from the direction that attack is coming from. In that time you can either dodge the attack, deflect it or parry it. 
  
 
    Deflecting and parrying the attacks will take quite a bit of practice but it will greatly benefit you and make the gaming experience far more competetive.
