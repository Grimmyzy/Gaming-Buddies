Gaming Buddies Website.


Gaming Buddies is a website I have invented in order to bring Gamers Closer together in the most commonly known competitive games. Many gamers often do not get to play games they want as their surrounding company might have other interests.

The main focus is to bring gamers' attention to the few games introduced by the website and build a society using social media sites and streaming services such as Twitch which would further help promote the Webpage.
